The code was tested using Matlab 2018b on Windows 10.

The code requires the RIR simulator to be installed (attached in this zip file at the folder "RIR\RIR-Generator-master"). Please see more detail at https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/habets/software/rir-generator

The main file is LoopWrapper.m. It calls all the other functions and scripts.

Inside LoopWrapper.m, in lines 20-26, there are flags controlling which figures to plot. Please note that only one of the flags should have a logical '1' value at a time. 

The code (along with its verified results) is published at Code Ocean at https://codeocean.com/capsule/1729785/tree/v1.
